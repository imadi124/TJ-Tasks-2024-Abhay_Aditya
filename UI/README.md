# Hi There! 😊

Welcome to my project where I recreate the **Google Pay** interface using **Figma**! 🎨✨

## 🚀 How I Built the Google Pay UI in Figma:

1. **Fire up Figma** 🔥  
2. Start with a fresh design by adding a new frame (shortcut: `F`) ✏️  
3. Choose your desired device frame — **Android** or **iOS** 📱  
4. Install these essential plugins:
   - **Font Awesome Icons** for perfect vector icons 🎯
   - **Remove BG** to easily erase backgrounds 🔄
   - **Unsplash** for copyright-free images 🖼️  
5. Now, let the fun begin! 🛠️ Create rectangles, ellipses, and import images for your background. Add those cool icons from the **Font Awesome** plugin to build features 🧩  
6. Use the **Text Tool** to craft, edit, and modify text as needed ✍️  
7. Feeling creative? 🎨 Use the **Pen Tool** to design your own icons! 🔥

## 🌟 What I Learned:

- Mastered the basic tools in **Figma** like the pen tool, plugins, and setting up APIs 🛠️  
- Explored key concepts such as **Frames**, **Pages**, **Layouts**, and **Layers** 🧱  
- Deep-dived into the world of **UX Design** and realized it's way more than just user experience! It also includes:
   - **UX Research** 🔍
   - **Wireframing** 🖼️
   - **Prototyping** 🛠️
   - **Image Analysis** 🖥️
   - **Color Theory** 🎨
   - And many more! (Still learning all these exciting things!) 🎓
