## 🚀 How I Built the Google Drive Empty State UI in Figma:  

### Frame 1: **Empty State Screen** 🗂️  
1. **Purpose**: Encourage users to add files using the "New" button.  
2. **Design**:  
   - Used a **minimalistic design** to keep the interface clean and inviting.  
   - Added a friendly message, **"Tap the + button to upload a file or create something new"**, to engage users.  
   - Used vector illustrations to depict the empty state, sourced from **Unsplash** or designed using the **Pen Tool**.  
   - Created a prominent **"New" button** for easy file upload.  

### Frame 2: **File Upload Options** 📁  
1. **Purpose**: Let users choose the type of file to upload.  
2. **Design**:  
   - Designed an **upload menu** with options like Sheets, PPTs, TXT files, and others.  
   - Incorporated **Font Awesome Icons** to represent each file type visually.  
   - Maintained a consistent layout with clear typography and color schemes for better UX.

### 🛠️ Tools and Plugins Used:  
1. **Font Awesome Icons** for icons of file types (Sheets, PPT, etc.) 🎯  
2. **Unsplash** for vector illustrations 🖼️  
3. **Remove BG** to clean up imported images 🔄  
4. **Prototyping Tool** to link the two frames for a seamless experience.
